## üìö Description

**Therminate** is an open-source Python package for evaluating thermal transient measurement data, such as those obtained from devices like the T3ster. It processes LED voltage data in CSV format using specialized algorithms to extract detailed thermal characteristics.

This tool serves as a modern and flexible alternative to proprietary evaluation software provided with thermal transient measurement equipment. Therminate outputs results as images and CSV files, facilitating easy analysis and visualization.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Data Processing**: Analyze thermal transient measurement data from CSV files.
- **Advanced Algorithms**: Utilize cutting-edge algorithms for precise thermal analysis.
- **Script Integration**: Easily embed Therminate into your Python scripts for automated processing.
- **Multiple Output Formats**: Generate results in images and CSV files for comprehensive examination.
- **Open Source**: Fully accessible source code for transparency and community contributions.
- **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux systems.

## üî¨ Evaluation Methods

Therminate offers a suite of evaluation methods for comprehensive thermal analysis:

1. **Standard Evaluation**
   - Performs default analysis to extract impedance and structure functions.
   - Ideal for quick assessments and initial data exploration.

2. **Evaluation Set**
   - Enables batch processing over various parameters or datasets.
   - Suitable for systematic studies requiring multiple evaluations.

3. **Bootstrap Evaluation**
   - Implements statistical bootstrap methods.
   - Assesses variability and confidence intervals of thermal properties.

4. **Optimization Evaluation**
   - Optimizes structure functions to fit impedance data.
   - Adjusts thermal resistance and capacitance for detailed layer-wise characterization.

5. **Theoretical Evaluation**
   - Generates theoretical thermal behavior models.
   - Aids in validating experimental data against expected results.

6. **Comparison Evaluation**
   - Compares multiple evaluation results or datasets.
   - Useful for benchmarking and identifying characteristic differences.

7. **Temperature Prediction Evaluation**
   - Predicts temperature profiles based on evaluated properties.
   - Essential for thermal management and design optimization.
