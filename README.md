## üìö Description

**PyRth** is an open-source Python package for evaluating thermal transient measurement data, such as those obtained from devices like the T3ster. It processes LED voltage data using specialized algorithms to extract detailed thermal characteristics such as the thermal structure function.

This tool serves as a modern and flexible alternative to proprietary evaluation software provided with thermal transient measurement equipment. PyRth optinally outputs results as images and CSV files, facilitating easy analysis and visualization.
