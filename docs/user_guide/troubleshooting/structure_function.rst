Structure Function
===================

This section addresses common issues and troubleshooting steps when applying the provided structure function calculation techniques in thermal transient analysis. The most common issue is related to insufficient numerical accuracy, which leads to a breakdown of the structure function calculation. Other issues may be related to a sparse sampling of the structure function or to a high noise level in the differential structure function.
