Deconvolution
===============

This section addresses common issues and troubleshooting steps related to the deconvolution process. Users may encounter various challenges when applying deconvolution techniques such as Bayesian deconvolution, LASSO deconvolution, or Fourier deconvolution. Typical problems include high computational costs, poor fit of the time constant spectrum to the original impedance, or high noise levels in the time constant spectrum.
