Derivation
===============

This section addresses common issues and troubleshooting steps related to the derivation process in thermal transient analysis. Users may encounter various challenges when applying derivation techniques to the impedance data such as high noise levels, biased results, or unexpected behavior in the impulse response. This guide aims to provide solutions and best practices based on real-world examples and user feedback.
